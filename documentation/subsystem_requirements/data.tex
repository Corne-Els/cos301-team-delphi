\subsubsection{Scope}
The data streaming subsystem is mostly concerned with aggregating and then analysing the live data stream originating from the mobile devices connected to the system. The most important data at this stage is the position information attached to a persistent ID of the mobile device generating it. Metadata generated from this stream includes population densities and congestion of routes.
