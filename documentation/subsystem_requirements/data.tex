\subsubsection{Scope}
The data streaming subsystem is mostly concerned with aggregating and then analysing the live data stream originating from the mobile devices connected to the system. The most important data at this stage is the position information attached to a persistent ID of the mobile device generating it. Metadata generated from this stream includes population densities and congestion of routes.
\subsubsection{Technology choices}
The data streaming subsystem can be broken up into 2 main systems, the publish-subscribe messaging system where all the data pours into, and the realtime stream processing system that analyses the data to generate useful metadata.
We will be using components from the Hadoop framework to build the data streaming subsystem. For the first system we will be using Apache Kafka which is a distributed messaging system. For the second system we will be using Apache Storm which is a distributed realtime stream computation system. Due to the distributed nature of these technology choices, they have some very attractive software attributes. See below for a full discussion.
