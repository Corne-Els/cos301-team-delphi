\subsubsection{Software Attributes}

	\paragraph{Efficiency}
	Efficiency: This system should require minimal battery power and data usage(preferably none), It should be able to use minimal resources to decide on a route to use... and this decision should be made fast with little to no latency.High cohesion: all functions will be directed towards the core function of direction the user from one location to another most efficiently
	\paragraph{Portability}
	It will also need to be protable so that is can work on the app, the webpage and on differnt phone devices
	\paragraph{Maintainability}
	Well we could say that it can easily maintain saved routes and sometimes incorporate them into the default routes that are used..And that routes that are may become unusable can be removed from the system with ease because of the delete route functionality
	Maintainability States also that there should be room for evolution, but I'm not sure whether we should cover that, as in, if it's in our scope, if that makes sense
	\paragraph{Cohesion}
	High cohesion: all functions will be directed towards the core function of direction the user from one location to another most efficiently
