\subsubsection{Software Attributes}
	
Maintainability

The GIS module should be easily understood and well documented in order to allow future developers the ability to add new functionality to the system or improve already implemented functionality.

Scalability

The GIS system should allow for n buildings and venues as new buildings or venues can be added in the future or the system could be deployed to other universities.
